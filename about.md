I am a conceptual programming software engineer, my focus is on simplifying and speeding up software development with focus on the needs of (potential) customers. My main interest is in creating proof of concepts and running greenfield projects. Purpose driven development is my main focus. I think that software should be written with a clear vision and purpose in mind, because otherwise misuse is lurking. The why is very important to me so I know what to change and what not to touch when developing.

I like to develop and work on new concepts in teamwork because I like to discuss problems with other to achieve the best results. To be honest, I am not the best developer to be hired, I am great in working on vision and outlining a new concept but much less interested in in-depth development. Also project based development is not my cup of tea, I am more of a product developer.

Writing conceptual documentation is also something I like to do, documenting also gives me insight in how to work with the concepts documented.
